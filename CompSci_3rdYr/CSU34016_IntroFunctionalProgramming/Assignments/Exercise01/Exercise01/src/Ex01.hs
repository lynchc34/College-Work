{- Part 1

Write a function 'raise' that converts a string to uppercase

Hint: 'toUpper :: Char -> Char' converts a character to uppercase
if it is lowercase. All other characters are unchanged.
It is imported should you want to use it.

-}
raise :: String -> String
raise str = map toUpper str


{- Part 2

Write a function 'nth' that returns the nth element of a list.
Hint: the test will answer your Qs

-}
nth :: Int -> [a] -> a
nth i xs = xs!!(i-1)


{- Part 3

Write a function `commonLen` that compares two sequences
and reports the length of the prefix they have in common.

-}
commonLen :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Int
commonLen (x:xs) (y:ys) | x == y = 1 + commonLen xs ys
commonLen _ _ = 0

{- Part 4

(TRICKY!) (VERY!)

Write a function `runs` that converts a list of things
into a list of sublists, each containing elements of the same value,
which when concatenated together give the same list

So `runs [1,2,2,1,3,3,3,2,2,1,1,4]`
 becomes `[[1],[2,2],[1],[3,3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[4]]`

Hint:  `elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool`

HINT: Don't worry about code efficiency
       Seriously, don't!

-}
runs :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
{-runs xs = [xs]-}
runs [] = []
runs (x:xs) = (x:takeWhile (==x) xs): runs (dropWhile (==x) xs)
